content: This week we continued putting efforts into scenes. Some are beginning to be implemented into Unity, now. As we're working in VR, it's important for us to make our as low-resource as possible to keep the experience visually smooth with a high FPS. This means that we are being frugal with our 3D topology, but working on making up for that loss of detail through high quality texturing and clever use of the shaders we developed earlier in this project.
